h1. PyroFormat

PyroFormat is your trusty Swiss Army Knife for formatting text, dates, numbers, and images in PyroCMS.

Right now it only does a few basic things (uppercase, number format, etc.) but we are adding new things soon.

Some ideas for the future. Many of these come directly from CodeIgniter, but it's nice to have access to them in tags.
